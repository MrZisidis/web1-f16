		Create a multi-page website for a client. Ideally the client should be a friend you have an existing positive relationship with (as long as they are not a student in this class). Possible site ideas are a business website for a restaurant, construction firm, consulting business, a portfolio website for a musician or visual artist. You have two weeks to complete the deliverables outlined in this document, due by the start of class on <span class="highlight">October 17<sup>th</sup></span>. Further iterations of this project will be due throughout the semester.

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Practice communicating with clients</li>
      <li>Practice understanding client needs and translating to web designs and actualized designs</li>
      <li>Practice communicating, justifying and promoting proposed ideas to clients</li>
      <li>Practice responding to and working with critical feedback from clients</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Choosing a Client</h2>
    Below are some attributes of a good client for this assignment:
    <ol>
      <li>The client will need a new website (or redesign) and does not have a deadline by which it will need to be completed</li>
      <li>The client must be able to provide any necessary content, including verbiage and imagery, when requested and in a timely fashion</li>
      <li>The client must be available for brief weekly phone calls or in-person meetings and occasional improptu consultations</li>
      <li>The client will not refrain from being honest with you (if your mother loves everything you do, she may not be a good candidate to be a client)</li>
      <li>The client does not have very “sophisticated” needs, such as heavy use of animation and interactivity, and does not need a “large” website (more than a dozen webpages)</li>
      <li>The client doesn’t need to be able to update the site themselves, or very often (in other words, they do not need a site powered by a content management system like Wordpress)</li>
      <li>The client realizes that you are a student learning web design and may not be able to complete their website to the level of completion or sophistication they desire</li>
      <li>The client is your friend</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>All due by the start of class on <span class="highlight">October 17<sup>th</sup></span>.</p>
    
    <h3>Client</h3>
    <ul class="sections">
      <li>Recruit and meet with your client. Assess their needs and take notes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Client Site Design Page</h3>
    <ul class="sections">
      <li>Create an HTML page that will serve as a place to post all of your interim deliverables including client meeting notes, design mockups, client needs assessment, etc… Link to this page from your <i>Student Page</i>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Client Needs</h3>
    <ol class="sections">
      <li>Post client meeting notes to your process page, these do not need to be HTML, you could link to a .txt file for example</li>
      <li>Identify the client’s needs and the needs of the client’s website visitors. Post a 500-word written essay describing these needs to your process page.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Competitive Audit, Inspiration</h3>
    <ol class="sections">
      <li>Find several websites of businesses related to your client. List them on your process page</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Architecture Diagram</h3>
    The purpose of an architecture diagram is to provide a clear organizational structure for the site’s content to later assist you during the building process.
    <ol class="sections">
      <li>Create an architecture diagram of the client's website and post to your process page. It should illustrate the linking between pages and list content available on each page.</li>
      <li>Assess the differences between your proposed features listed in your architecture diagram and those found on the competitor websites. Do you have any they don't have, or visa-versa. Make sure you can justify differences.</li>
    </ol>
        
    <h3>Sketches</h3>
    <p>Create website sketches on paper to explore the visual layout of the various pages of the website.</p>
    <p>Sketches can happen at any time during the design process. It can sometimes be useful to sketch ideas on paper during the initial client meeting. If the client is accustomed to viewing hand-drawn sketches this can be an effective way of understanding the client's desires and needs.</p>
    <ol class="sections">
      <li>Post photos or scans of your sketches to your process page</li>
    </ol>
