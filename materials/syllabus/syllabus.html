  <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
  <p>Students in the Graphic Design Department must maintain a minimum C+ average in their required major courses each semester to proceed in the major. Students whom the faculty feel would benefit from a check-in of their progress may receive written notice
    of a mid-semester review for the following semester. This is not a formal review, and no special action is required of students - faculty will write up an evaluation based on the current coursework and performance of the students being reviewed.</p>
  <p>Students who do not achieve a minimum C+ average in their major courses are considered to be on departmental probation. Any course in which a student on departmental probation receives a C or below must be retaken. Due to the sequential nature of the
    Graphic Design program’s courses, this may entail taking a “special program” until the required course in question is offered again the following year. Such a special program will be designed by the chair on a case-by-case basis. If the grades of
    a student on probation fall below a C+ average a second time, the student is subject to dismissal from the program.</p>
  <p>Students at all levels are allowed to repeat a semester or year only once in the program, after which they will be dismissed from the major.</p>
  <p>Reviews in Graphic Design occur twice a year - in December and in May. Review times are posted in the Design Office the week before reviews. Review performance is factored into students’ final course grades by their instructors. Students are required
    to attend their reviews. Lateness of more than 5 minutes beyond the posted review time is considered missing the review. Missing a review without written proof of a medical or family emergency is grounds for failing all required courses.</p>

  <h2>Graduate</h2>
  <p>The following addendum applies to students taking the course for graduate credit.</p>
  <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Demonstrate visual communication skills through the use of graphic illustrations, photography and typography</li>
    <li>Integrate composition and design in support of concept</li>
    <li>Demonstrate the ability to code functional requirements of projects</li>
    <li>Apply critical thinking and needs analysis to concept design and development</li>
  </ul>    
    
  <h3>Content</h3>
  <p>Graduate students should demonstrate an ability to work and learn independently. In addition to the requirements listed in course assignments graduate students should demonstrate an understanding of materials in the course text and outside resources through their work output. Students must show an ability to articulate their design intentions and to analyze and make suggestions about the work of others.</p>

  <h3>Assessment</h3>
  Graduate students should demonstrate:
  <ul>
    <li>The design of web pages that are aesthetic, functional, appropriate to content and targeted at a specific user group.</li>
    <li>Presentation of content within a clear visual hierarchy.</li>
    <li>Organization and grouping of site content into logical and understandable groups.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Attendance</h2>
  <p>During the first week of classes, faculty state clearly their expectations for performance and attendance, their method of recording attendance, and their expectations for makeup work and examinations. All students must attend the first day of classes
    for which they are registered to reserve a place in the course. If a student cannot attend because of illness or other emergency, he or she must email faculty before the first class meeting to inform the faculty member of their absence. A student
    who misses the first meeting of a class without notice may be dropped from the roster by the instructor. Students are expected to attend all classes. Faculty have the right to assign an "F" or "NC" grade to a student who attends less than 80 percent
    of the meetings of any course. There are no formally excused absences for any reason, including illness. However, a student who will miss one or two classes may be able to make up missed work, at the discretion of each instructor. If a student will
    miss one or two classes due to illness, he or she should notify all current faculty members by e-mail. For absences of two or more class meetings due to illness, the student may contact the director of counseling to request a leave of absence.</p>

  <h2>Students with Disabilities Statement</h2>
  <p>Massachusetts College of Art and Design is committed to fostering the academic, personal, and professional growth of our students. We are especially committed to ensuring that students with documented disabilities, as defined under the Americans with
    Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), are provided equal access to all campus resources and opportunities. If you believe you have a disability that may warrant accommodations, I urge you to contact Ms. Erla Shehu (<a href="mailto:erla.shehu@massart.edu">erla.shehu@massart.edu</a>    or 617-879-7692) in the Academic Resource Center, Tower 8th floor. The Academic Resource Center provides access to a learning specialist, an academic coach and professional tutors.</p>

  <h2>Grading System</h2>
  <p>Two grading systems are used at the college: Letter grades (A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D, F, Incomplete, W) are given in the following courses: Liberal Arts, Art Education, Fashion Design, Graphic Design, Industrial Design, Animation, Illustration,
    and Architectural Design, and History of Art Pass/ No Credit / Incomplete/ W grades are given in the following courses: First year studio courses (Studio Foundation - SFDN), Film/Video, Photography, Studio for Interrelated Media, Fine Arts 2D - Painting,
    Printmaking, Fine Arts 3D - Ceramics, Fibers, Glass, Jewelry/Metalsmithing, Sculpture</p>

  <h2>Grade Definitions</h2>
  <ul class="grades">
    <li><span class="grade">A</span> Exceptional work in all respects. </li>
    <li><span class="grade">B</span> Above average work, distinguished in certain but not all respects.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">C</span> Average.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">C-</span> Below average</li>
    <li><span class="grade">D</span> Lowest passing grade; individual departments may set standards for the application of "D" grades toward progress in the major.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">F</span> Failing work. No credit is given.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">Pass</span> Work meeting all expectations for successful completion of the course.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">NC</span> No Credit. Work that does not meet the expectations of the course.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">Inc</span> Incomplete. A temporary designation indicating that at least 80% of the course requirements have been met and that the remaining course requirements are expected to be completed, and a permanent designation issued by
      the subsequent mid-semester. The student is responsible for having an Individual Grade Sheet completed by the appropriate faculty member and filed with the registrar. If the student does not complete the course work, a non-passing grade will be
      issued after the midpoint of the following semester. </li>
    <li><span class="grade">W</span> Withdrawn from the course. No credit earned. W grades do not appear on the student's transcript.</li>
  </ul>
  If a failing grade is received in a required course, students must take the course again and pass it. This rule does not apply to a student who changed majors and who did not pass requirements for a previous concentration.

  <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
  <p>In creative work, plagiarism is the inappropriate and unethical representation of another's work as one's own. In those instances where a significant portion of a creative work is intentionally "appropriated," plagiarism is the failure to note, orally
    or in writing, the source of the appropriation. In expository or academic writing, whenever your work incorporates someone else's research, images, words, or ideas, you must properly identify the source unless you can reasonably expect knowledgeable
    people to recognize it. Proper citation gives credit where it is due and enables your readers to locate sources and pursue lines of inquiry raised by your paper. Students who do not comply may be penalized.</p>
