		<div>
			<h3>max-width: 100%;</h3>
			<p>
				Make sure to always have
				<code>
					<pre>
img {
  max-width: 100%; 
}
					</pre>
				</code>
				in your css file so that images won't escape out of their containers as you resize them.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>target รท context = result</h3>
			<p>Ethan's
				<code>target รท context = result</code> was developed in a time when many web design teams had very separate roles for designers and front-end coders. Designers would often create mockups in Photoshop then hand them over to developers. Now (and especially
				when working alone) it makes perfect sense to just work with %s directly in your css; forget trying to copy your PSD exactly.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>scale &amp; device-width</h3>
			<p>
        Almost always you should have the following line in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your website.
				<code>
					<pre>
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width" /&gt;
					</pre>
				</code>
			</p>
      <p>
        You should pretty much never add <code>maximum-scale=1</code> to the above line because that will prevent users from using pinch-to-zoom which many, many, many, many people use (and need) to actually see your website.
      </p>
